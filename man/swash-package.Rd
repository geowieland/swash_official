Implementation of the Swash-Backwash Model for the Single Epidemic Wave and additional functions in R 
}

\description{
Swash-Backwash Model for the single epidemic wave (Cliff and Haggett 2006) with additional functions for bootstrap confidence intervals and data management; other functions for spatio-temporal analysis and modeling of infectious diseases
}

\details{
The Swash-Backwash Model (SBM) for the Single Epidemic Wave is the spatial equivalent of the classic epidemiological SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. It was developed by Cliff and Haggett (2006) to model the velocity of spread of infectious diseases across space. Current applications can be found, for example, in Smallman-Raynor et al. (2022a,b). This package enables the calculation of the Swash-Backwash Model for user-supplied panel data on regional infections. The core of this is the \code{swash()} function, which calculates the model and creates a model object of the \code{sbm} class defined in this package. This class can be used to visualize results (\code{summary()}, \code{plot()}) and calculate bootstrap confidence intervals for the model estimates (\code{confint(sbm)}); the latter returns an object of class \code{sbm_ci} as defined in this package. Two \code{sbm_ci} objects for different countries may be compared with \code{compare_countries()}, which allows the estimation of mean differences of a user-specified model parameter (e.g., spatial reproduction number \eqn{R_{OA}}) between two countries. This makes it possible to check whether the spatial spread velocity of a communicable disease is significantly different in one country than in another country; the result is an object of class \code{countries}.

The package also contains other functions for spatio-temporal analysis and modeling of infectious diseases, such as fitting logistic growth models and exponential growth models for the initial phase of a spread, all of which can be used both on \code{sbm} objects (\code{growth(sbm)}, \code{growth_initial(sbm)}) and stand-alone (\code{logistic_growth())}, \code{exponential_growth()}). These function return objects of class \code{loggrowth} and \code{expgrowth}, respectively, both defined in this package. Other functions include spatial statistics (\code{nbstat()} for neighborhood statistics), breakpoints analysis for time series models (\code{plot_breakpoints()}), and fit metrics (\code{metrics()}, \code{binary_metrics()}, \code{binary_metrics_glm()}). The package includes example data from the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic.
