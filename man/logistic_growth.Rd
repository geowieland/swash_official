     Start value of the saturation value for estimation
}
  \item{S_end}{
     End value of the saturation value for estimation
}
  \item{S_iterations}{
     Number of iterations for saturation value search
}
  \item{S_start_est_method}{
     Method for saturation value search, either "bisect" or "trial_and_error"
}
 \item{seq_by}{
     No of segments for the "trial_and_error" estimation of the saturation value
}
 \item{nls}{
     Nonlinear estimation? \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}
}
}

\details{
This function allows the estimation of a logistic growth model. The user must specify the dependent variable (cumulative infections) and the time variable (time counter or date values). The estimation is performed using a linearized model as an OLS estimator and as an NLS estimator. For the former, the saturation value can either be specified by the user or found using a search algorithm. The parameters from the OLS fit are used as starting values for the NLS estimation.
