Description: The Swash-Backwash Model for the Single Epidemic Wave was developed by Cliff and Haggett (2006) <doi:10.1007/s10109-006-0027-8> to model the velocity of spread of infectious diseases across space. This package enables the calculation of the Swash-Backwash Model for user-supplied panel data on regional infections. The package provides additional functions for bootstrap confidence intervals, country comparison, visualization of results, and data management. Furthermore, it contains several functions for analysis and visualization of (spatial) infection data.
